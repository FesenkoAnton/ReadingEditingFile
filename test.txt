A musical example of migrating C code to Java.
 
It has long been recognized that there is a correlation between software development 
aptitude and music appreciation. This is the first in a series of articles that leverages 
that correlation by featuring aspects of Java (and related APIs) for developing applications 
in the music domain. The applications in this series typically perform music analysis or algorithmic composition.
 
The application that I'd like to begin highlighting in this article is one that I developed, 
known as Counterpoint Composer.  This application will serve, among other things, as an example 
of migrating a procedural C program into an object-oriented Java program.   Before diving into 
relevant portions of the code, it will be helpful to explore a bit of an introduction to counterpoint music.
